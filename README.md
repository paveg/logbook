## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

This blog follows a minimal design approach with focus on:

- **Readability** - System fonts and optimal line heights for comfortable reading
- **Accessibility** - High contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support  
- **Performance** - No unnecessary JavaScript or heavy assets
- **Maintainability** - Clean code structure with consistent CSS variables

## ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode

The blog includes a comprehensive dark mode implementation:

- Automatic detection of system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Manual toggle with animated sun/moon icons
- Persistent user preference via localStorage
- WCAG AA compliant color combinations in both themes

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This is a static site that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Cloudflare Pages** - Recommended for optimal performance
- **Netlify** - Easy deployment with Git integration
- **Vercel** - Great for automatic deployments
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting for public repositories
